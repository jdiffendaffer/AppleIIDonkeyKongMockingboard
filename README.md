Simple music player for the Apple II's Mockingboard.
Based loosely on a Z80 program I found with the Virtual Aquarius emulator
It plays the same song data anyway.
Initial 6502 port was for the Oric which also interfaces
the AY sound chip through a VIA chip similar to the Mockingboard.
Use the CC65's assembler/linker to build it with the batch files.
